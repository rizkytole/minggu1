SaaS: Software as a Service
It simply means running applications at public clouds. The user uses these apps via the Internet. These apps are maintained by the Service Provider. Some e.g., of Service Providers, are SalesForce, Microsoft(Office 365), Oracle, Google(Google Apps), etc.
In IaaS, you select the pre-canned OS layer, deploy the application stack, deploy your code & then add your data
In PaaS, you deploy your code (OS/Application Stack is part of the offering) & then add your data
In SaaS, you add your data (everything else part of the offering)

SAAS Architecture:
With this model, a single version of the application, with a single configuration is used for all customers. The application is installed on multiple machines to support scalability (called horizontal scaling). In some cases, a second version of the application is set up to offer a select group of customers with access to pre-release versions of the applications for testing purposes. In this traditional model, each version of the application is based on a unique code. Although an exception , some SaaS solutions do not use multitenancy, to cost-effectively manage a large number of customers in place. Whether multitenancy is a necessary component for software-as-a-service is a topic of controversy.
There are two main varieties of SaaS:
Vertical SaaS
A Software which answers the needs of a specific industry (e.g., software for the healthcare, agriculture, real estate, finance industries)
Horizontal SaaS
The products which focus on a software category (marketing, sales, developer tools, HR) but are industry agnostic.
Key Features and Benefits of a SaaS Platform
Simplicity
Software applications architected as SaaS solutions are typically accessed over the web through various types of devices. Advancements in client-side programming languages such as JavaScript have resulted in more intuitive web interfaces and as such, make using applications delivered over the internet as easy to use as their desktop counterparts.
Economical
The monthly or annual subscript fee payment model makes it easier for businesses to budget, couple this with zero infrastructure setup costs, it’s easy to see how opting to use SaaS solutions can save the business money.
Security
Security is an important aspect of software development solutions and SaaS platforms are no different.  As a consumer of an application architected using SaaS, you don’t need to concern yourself with how your data is being locked down.  It’s held securely in the cloud!
Compatibility
With traditional software installations, updates and patches can occasionally require enormous amounts of time and money.  This is especially true in the enterprise.
Queuing system for your SaaS application
Let’s talk about a queuing system now.
A message queuing system is an asynchronous communication protocol, enabling sender and receiver of a message not interacting at the same time.
Also known as Message Queuing (MSMQ) technology it enables web apps to run at different times and to communicate with various 3rd party integrations / APIs / and other services asynchronously.
RabbitMQ
Again, I’d like to give you some insights on the queuing system we use. RabbitMQ is a great open source queuing system running on all major operating systems.
AWS & EC2
Building a scalable web app you’ll probably end up at using Amazon Web Services sooner or later. My guess is sooner 
AWS enables you to host and run your web apps as well as performing massive high-performing batch jobs. With Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) AWS provides scalable virtual servers for every business.
